                    Sam has been one of the best arcade gamers of his time. Once in an international 
                    tournament NASA sent the video recording of all the games to space for intelligent 
                    beings to find and know more about humans. However the aliens interpreted the games 
                    as a challenge and began attacking Earth using the video game data. It's now up to 
                    Sam and other old time arcade game champions to save the Earth from the video game 
                    alien invasion.
