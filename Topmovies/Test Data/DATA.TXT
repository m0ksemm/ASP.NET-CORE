In Johannesburg, the police department reduced the high rating of criminality using robots from the 
Tetravaal Company, designed by the engineer Deon Wilson. The former military Vincent Moore is envious 
of Deon, since he has developed another project called Moose, but neither Tetravaal nor the police 
department is interested. Deon has just developed an Artificial Intelligence but the Tetravaal's 
CEO Michelle Bradley asks him to abort the project. Deon decides to bring the damaged Robot 22 
that was sent to be crushed to test his A.I. However he is kidnapped by the criminals Ninja, 
Yo-Landi and Amerika that want him to stop the robot cops. When they see the damaged robot in 
the van, they force Deon to program it to heist banks with them and they call it Chappie. 
However, Chappie acts like a child and need to be trained to learn and grow. Meanwhile 
Vincent follows Deon and plots an evil scheme to activate his robot.
